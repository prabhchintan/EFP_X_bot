well first couple of thoughts:

even though the bot kept running as intended, twitter after the first two times said you can't post the same tweet over and over -- so we need to come up with a way to change the text so it doesn't say that.

second, i want to run the schedule via github actions so just keep that in mind -- that i want to host this repo on github but have github actions run the python file every 30 mins (not sure how to handle keys like that but just mentioning)

third, think of a more efficient way to not have to look up .eth names and somehow reduce the number of requests the script sends in general. i just started this project and am open to all interpretations

fourth, i have a list of .eth names to watch for -- which i can curate overtime. but the point is that the bot should a) watch for activity changes on these accounts, but also in general any interesting activity happening on the protocol, namely:

- create a list aka follow anyone for the first time (tweet something like "vitalik.eth created an EFP list")
- follow, unfollow, block, mute another noteworthy person

i have specific documentation for each of these which i will share with you so ask promptly which documentation you need to make it happen.

lastly, - tag @efp in the tweet instead of saying "EFP", and
- include a link to EFP app page for the account that did the action (e.g. if vitalik.eth does something, then link to testing.ethfollow.xyz/vitalik.eth, or once we launch then simply ethfollow.xyz/vitalik.eth)

we can go step by step slowly to meet these requirements but i'm listing them out so you know

Thank you for providing such a comprehensive list of requirements and improvements. This gives us a clear direction to enhance the bot. Let's address these points one by one:
Avoiding duplicate tweets:
We can add variability to the tweets by including timestamps, randomizing emoji, or mentioning changes since the last update.
GitHub Actions:
We'll need to adjust the script to run as a single job rather than a continuous process. We'll also need to use GitHub Secrets for storing sensitive information like API keys.
Efficient ENS name lookup:
We can implement caching for ENS names to reduce API calls. We might also batch requests where possible.
Watching specific accounts and general activity:
We'll need to implement functions to check for various types of activities and store the state between runs.
Tagging and linking:
We'll update the tweet formatting to include these elements.
